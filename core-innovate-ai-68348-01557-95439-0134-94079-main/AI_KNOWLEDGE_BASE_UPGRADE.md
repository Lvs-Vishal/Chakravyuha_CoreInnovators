## 📚 Question Generation Logic

The system uses intelligent templates to generate thousands of variations:

```typescript
// Example: CO2 level questions
for each level in [400, 500, 600, ..., 5000] {
  generate: "Is {level} ppm CO2 dangerous?"
  generate: "What does {level} ppm CO2 mean?"
  generate: "How to reduce CO2 from {level} ppm?"
}

// Example: Room-specific questions
for each room in [bedroom, kitchen, living room, ...] {
  for each time in [morning, evening, night, ...] {
    generate: "Why is CO2 high in {room} {time}?"
  }
}
```

This creates comprehensive coverage without manual entry!
