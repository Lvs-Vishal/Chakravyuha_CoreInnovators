## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?

#### 1. Check Console for Errors:
```javascript
❌ Failed to send email: [error message]
```

**Common Issues:**
- Wrong Template ID → Verify in EmailJS dashboard
- Wrong Public Key → Check account settings
- Email service not connected → Connect Gmail/Outlook
- Quota exceeded → Check usage in dashboard

#### 2. Check Spam Folder:
- EmailJS emails may go to spam initially
- Mark as "Not Spam" to whitelist

#### 3. Verify EmailJS Template:
- Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/templates
- Open template `template_gjzs6a5`
- Make sure all variables are correct:
  - `{{to_email}}`
  - `{{subject}}`
  - `{{message}}`
  - `{{timestamp}}`
  - `{{co2_level}}`
  - `{{co_level}}`
  - `{{air_quality}}`
  - `{{smoke_level}}`
  - `{{flame_status}}`

#### 4. Check Service Connection:
- Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/services
- Verify service `service_t50h7hw` is active
- Make sure Gmail/Outlook is connected
- Test connection in dashboard

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

### Check EmailJS Usage:

1. **Go to:** https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin
2. **View:** Sent emails count
3. **Monitor:** Daily/monthly usage
4. **Upgrade:** If approaching 200/month limit

### Check Alert History:

Open browser console (F12):
```javascript
// View all alerts
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('gasAlerts'))

// Count alerts today
const alerts = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('gasAlerts') || '[]');
const today = new Date().toDateString();
const todayAlerts = alerts.filter(a => 
  new Date(a.timestamp).toDateString() === today
);
console.log(`Emails sent today: ${todayAlerts.length}`);
```
